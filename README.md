#  A Blog in Bootstrap and Ruby on Rails 

Due to Separation of Concerns (SoC), This Blog will run on Bootstrap on the Client-side or Frontend (UXD & UID) and Ruby on Rails on the Server-side or Backend (Data Accessibility, Security, etc).


## Synopsis of Software Development and Design for this Project.

I have developed the blog's Frontend with [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the Backend will run on [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails). That means that this is one of two separate projects which will be merged together to complete the 'mega' project and enhance it's functionalities.

The hard coding we used to do with Vanilla JS has really been phased off by Bootstrap due to it's [RWD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) abilities, CDN,  and it's ability to save time; making it an absolute tool in enhancing the UXD and UID. 

Bootstrap uses a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) as well as Local Framework files which can be linked via stylesheets in your project and deliver the same functionality with ease. I used a CDN in my project cos I have broadband :-). When working with clients across the globe, using local files would be way easier espeially the minified versions which will guarantee the projects functionality even with slow internet conections. 

As noted above, I used Bootstrap 3 and as we speak, [Bootstrap 4.0.0 Alpha.5](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) is already in use but been an Alpha version, there is still some time to go before the final version is released. Alpha.5 was released in September 2016 and we are still waiting for the Beta. I have used Alpha.5 in some projects and there are still some bugs to be fixed. In my opinion, Bootstrap 3 will continue to be supported as long as it takes and migrating wont be a big deal because it's structure is not so diverse like AngularJS 1 to AngularJS 2.

The most important things to point out that I observed during the Project as far as Frontend Development is concerned are the following; 

## Design Guidelines I used.

    <li>Maintainalibility of the Blog</li>
    <li>SEO</li>
    <li>Security</li>
    <li>Progressive Enhancement</li>

</ol>



## Why Bootstrap

This Framework does really save time when it comes to building web applications and it works pretty well with Ruby on Rails which is been interwoven in the main web development platforms. I have just completed the [Frontend Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) of this application using Bootstrap which is really a cool.

Why use Vanilla JS and/or Vanilla CSS if you can use Bootstrap?
The Frontend of this application is 90% done with Bootstrap but I decided to add my own custom CSS stylesheets to tweak the responsiveness. My main aim was to use Ruby on Rails together with Bootstrap and not make the page super responsive and extremely sexy. The backend is been done with Ruby on Rails to allow submission of forms and communication between servers, etc.

### Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap is maintained under [the Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/). Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.

See [the Releases section of our GitHub project](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases) for changelogs for each release version of Bootstrap. Release announcement posts on [the official Bootstrap blog](https://blog.getbootstrap.com) contain summaries of the most noteworthy changes made in each release.
