# Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap

## Synopsis of Software Development and Design for this Project.

Everytime I never cease to astound myself with the beauty of [Ruby on Rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails). 

This Framework does really save time when it comes to building web applications and it's been interwoven in the main web develoment platforms. I have just completed the [Frontend Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) of this application using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which is really a cool way to do things.

Bootstrap uses a [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) as well as Local Framework files which can be linked via stylesheets in your project and deliver the same functionality with ease. I used a CDN in my project cos I have broadband :-). When working with clients across the globe, using local files would be way easier espeially the minified versions which will guarantee the projects functionality with or without internet. 

## Why Bootstrap

It's amazing. Why use Vanilla JS and/or Vanilla CSS if you can use Bootstrap?
The Frontend of this application is 90% done with Bootstrap but I decided to add my own custom CSS stylesheets. My aim was to use Ruby on Rails together with Bootstrap and not make the page super responsive and extremely sexy. The backend will be done with Ruby on Rails to allow submission of forms and communication between servers.
